name: change-disposition
description: Close an OpenSpec change or attached bead without implementing it by recording an exact superseded, deferred, or rejected disposition and archiving without spec merges. Use when a proposal is superseded, should be deferred, is irrelevant or wontfix, must be rejected, needs archive skip-specs, or should be killed without implementation.

# Change Disposition

Treat disposition as a terminal close-without-implementation workflow. Preserve the proposal and
its decision evidence, prevent unimplemented deltas from entering main specifications, and surface
every active dependent before closure.

**MANDATORY:** Before writing a marker, read
[references/marker-templates.md](references/marker-templates.md) completely. Use one template
without renaming or inventing fields.

## Choose exactly one disposition

| Disposition | Use when | Required lineage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `superseded` | A named change now owns the same intent | `superseded-by: <change-id>` |
| `deferred` | The intent survives, but work is parked indefinitely | `reopen-when: <concrete condition>` |
| `rejected` | The work is irrelevant, unjustified, or not worth doing | A specific rationale |

Normalize informal requests such as “abandoned,” “cancelled,” or “wontfix” to the disposition
whose meaning matches. Marker filenames and fields use only `superseded`, `deferred`, or
`rejected`; never persist an informal synonym as a fourth disposition.

Do not use `deferred` for a scheduled pause with an ordinary resumption date. Keep that change
active or use the repository's normal task deferral mechanism. A disposition is indefinite and
terminal until an explicit reopen condition is met.

## Stop when disposition is unsafe

Stop and report a rollback or completion decision instead when any proposed behavior or spec delta
has already merged into the main specification tree. Partially implemented work may require
reversion, migration, or normal completion; `--skip-specs` cannot undo merged behavior.

Also stop when:

- no authorized decision identifies the disposition and deciding context;
- `superseded` lacks a real replacement change;
- `deferred` lacks an observable reopen condition;
- a live claim owns the change or an affected dependent;
- the change cannot be resolved to one active directory;
- repository instructions require a different terminal process.

## Capture pre-closure evidence

1. Resolve the active change directory and any attached feature or task beads.
2. Validate the change using the repository's strict OpenSpec command.
3. Count checked and total task boxes from the authoritative task artifact. Record the result as
   `tasks-at-closure`; do not check unfinished tasks merely to make the count look complete.
4. Confirm that none of `SUPERSEDED.md`, `DEFERRED.md`, or `REJECTED.md` already exists.
5. Fingerprint the main specification tree before archival. Use a byte-level repository command,
   for example:

```bash
find openspec/specs -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum
```

Preserve the resulting digest in the execution evidence. If the repository has no main spec tree,
record that fact rather than creating one.

## Write exactly one marker

Create the disposition's canonical marker in the active change directory:

- `superseded` → `SUPERSEDED.md`
- `deferred` → `DEFERRED.md`
- `rejected` → `REJECTED.md`

Fill every common field: decision date, deciding context, reason, task completion state, and
dependents swept. Add `superseded-by` only for superseded work and `reopen-when` only for deferred
work. Use an ISO date and a stable deciding-context locator such as a session, handoff, decision
record, or proposal.

Reject closure if more than one canonical marker exists. Do not use `ABANDONED.md`,
`CANCELLED.md`, `WONTFIX.md`, prose-only task notes, or a custom archive directory.

## Sweep active dependents

Search active proposals for the exact change id before archiving:

```bash
rg -n -F "$change_id" openspec/changes --glob 'proposal.md'
```

Inspect every match in `depends on`, `Extends`, and `after:` metadata or prose. For each dependent,
either amend it under the current authority or list it in the marker's `## Dependents swept`
section as a follow-up disposition candidate. Do not silently leave a dependency pointing at a
terminal change.

When a proposal supersedes other changes, require its own `## Context` to name every superseded
change. If that lineage is missing and cannot be amended safely, stop before closure.

## Close attached beads

Close attached task and feature beads with the matching structured reason prefix:

```text
superseded: <replacement-change-id>
deferred: <reopen-condition>
rejected: <rationale>
```

Keep the exact prefix lowercase and include the required value after the colon. Follow repository
ordering for child, feature, and epic closure. Do not close a long-lived capability epic merely
because one feature is dispositioned. If the repository has no beads or no attached bead, record
that explicitly in the completion evidence.

## Archive without merging deltas

Archive only after the marker, dependent sweep, and bead updates are complete:

```bash
openspec archive "$change_id" --skip-specs -y
```

Never omit `--skip-specs`. Never use normal archive-on-success semantics for a dispositioned
change, even when its delta appears harmless.

After archival:

1. Confirm the change no longer appears in the active change list.
2. Confirm the standard dated archive directory exists and contains exactly one canonical marker.
3. Recompute the main-spec fingerprint and require it to equal the pre-archive digest.
4. Run the repository's archive and workflow closure checks.
5. Persist the archive and tracker state using the repository's required commit and push policy.

If the main-spec fingerprint changed, stop. Preserve the evidence and repair through the
repository's explicit recovery process; do not claim a successful disposition.

## Report completion

Report the disposition, marker path, deciding context, task count at closure, dependents amended or
flagged, bead close reasons, exact archive command, archive location, before/after spec digest,
validation results, and persistence outcome. A marker without the dependent sweep, non-merging
archive, or required tracker closure is incomplete.
